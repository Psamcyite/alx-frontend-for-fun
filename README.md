To convert Markdown to HTML, you can use a Markdown processor or an online converter. Below are instructions for both methods:

### **Using a Markdown Processor (Node.js)**

If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `marked` package, a markdown parser and compiler, to convert a Markdown file to HTML. First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

1. **Install the `marked` package globally** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   npm install -g marked
   ```

2. **Convert Markdown to HTML**:

   ```bash
   marked README.md > output.html
   ```

   This command will generate `output.html` containing the HTML version of your README.md file.

### **Using an Online Converter**

Several online tools can convert Markdown to HTML. Here are the steps using the popular [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) online Markdown editor:

1. **Visit [Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/).**

2. **Paste your Markdown content into the editor.**

3. **Click on the "Export as" option in the top menu.**

4. **Select "Static HTML."**

5. **Copy the generated HTML code.**

Now, you have the HTML version of your Markdown content.

Remember, using a Markdown processor programmatically gives you more control if you need to automate the conversion process or integrate it into a larger workflow. Online converters are convenient for occasional use.
